## Cloutlayer Themes

Cloutlayer uses a simple templating language called [Handlebars](http://handlebarsjs.com/) for its themes.

[Read the Handlebars documentation](https://handlebarsjs.com/guide/). _It's super easy._ ðŸ˜‰

## Development

You'll need [Node](https://nodejs.org/), Java and [Gulp](https://gulpjs.com) installed globally. 
After that, from the theme's root directory:

```bash
# install dependencies
npm install

# run development server
gulp dev
```

### Commands

- ```gulp dev```: Runs the development server locally.
- ```gulp build```: Compiles CSS and JS files.
- ```gulp zip```: Packages the theme files into `dist/theme-<timestamp>.zip`, which you can then upload to your website.
- ```gulp zipAssets```: Packages the theme design assets into `dist/theme-assets-<timestamp>.zip`, which you can then upload to your website.

## Project Structure

- `assets`: design assets â€” example: styles, scripts, images, fonts and icons
- `assets/built`: compiled styles (CSS) and scripts (JS)
- `data`: data to apply to Handlebars templates
- `public`: robots.txt, humans.txt, favicon and manifests
- `templates`: entry templates â€” example: layouts and pages
- `templates/partials`: reusable templates â€” example: header, footer, etc
